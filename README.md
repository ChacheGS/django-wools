Django Wools
============

Django tools from WITH.

That's a collection of things that we at [WITH](https://with-madrid.com/) got
tired of copy/pasting in every project.

## Install

```
pip install django_wools
```

## Included Wools

### Storage

#### `django_wools.storage.GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage`

That's a sub-class of the 
[ManifestStaticFilesStorage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#manifeststaticfilesstorage)
but that makes sure that along with all the files comes a `.gz` version which
is easy to pick up for nginx (or other static files server).

### Middlewares

#### `django_wools.middlewares.NowMiddleware`

Suppose that you have a content that is available up until a given date. When
the date is passed then everything related to this content expires. However,
in order to do this, you're probably going to make several request, possibly in
loosely connected parts of your code. In those cases, when looking at the time,
the clock will show different value as the time passes between calls. It means
that you could very well end up with one half of your code considering that the
object is still valid but the other half that it expired.

In order to prevent this, the simplest is to consider that the time is fixed
and that the code executes instantly at the moment of the request. The goal
of this middleware is to save the current time at each request and then to
provide an easy way to get the current time through the request.

If the middleware is activated, you should be able to get the time like this:

```python
from time import sleep
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    print(f"Now is {request.now()}")
    sleep(42)
    print(f"Now is still {request.now()}")

    return render(request, "something.html", {"now": request.now()})
```

#### `django_wools.middlewares.SlowMiddleware`

When developing a SPA or hybrid app, you want to make sure that the app is
structurally ready to handle load times from the server, even if the connection
is a bit shaky. Also, you want to make sure that not too many requests are
sent.

In order for you to fully realize how slow your website is going to be on a bad
connection, th e SlowMiddleware will automatically add a delay before replying
to each request.

Add this to your `settings.py`

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    "django_wools.middlewares.SlowMiddleware",
]

SLOW_MIDDLEWARE_LATENCY = 1 if DEBUG else 0
```

By doing this, your requests will be added a 1s delay if the `DEBUG` mode is
enabled.

### Database

#### `django_wools.db.require_lock`

Provides a way to explicitly generate a PostgreSQL lock on a table.

By example:

```python
from django.db.transaction import atomic
from django_wools.db import require_lock

from my_app.models import MyModel


@atomic
@require_lock(MyModel, 'ACCESS EXCLUSIVE')
def myview(request):
    # do stuff here
```

### Wagtail Images

Several Wagtail-specific tags are provided to deal with images and more
specifically responsive images. To use it:

1. Add `django_wools` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
2. Import `wools_for_wt_images` from your template

```
{% load wools_for_wt_images %}
```

Some specific settings can be set:

- `WOOLS_MAX_PIXEL_RATIO` _(default: `3`)_ &mdash; Highest device pixel ratio
  to support.
- `WOOLS_INCREMENT_STEP_PERCENT` _(default: `(sqrt(2) - 1) * 100`)_ &mdash; The
  percentage of increase from the base density to the next one. The default
  values will generate `x1`, `x2` and `x4` with intermediate values that are
  `x1.4142` and `x2.8284`.

All the tags will be default generate WebP images with a PNG fallback. The
fallback can be changed to JPEG and the main format has to be WebP.

#### `image_fixed_size`

This tag will generate a `<picture>` tag for an image whose size in pixels you
known in advance. That picture size will be enforced in the HTML code with
inline properties.

Usage:

```
{% image_fixed_size max-500x500 %}
```

The arguments to this tag, in order, are:

- `image` &mdash; The Wagtail-compatible image itself
- `spec` &mdash; A spec like you would give to Wagtail (`fill-500x500`,
   `max-500x500`, etc)
- `fallback_format` &mdash; The format to fallback in case the browser doesn't
  support WebP. Can either be `"jpeg"` or `"png"`. Defaults to `"png"`.
- `lossless` &mdash; A boolean to enable losslessness of WebP. This does not
  affect the fallback format, so if you want a lossless fallback as well you'll
  need to use PNG.

### Fonts

Wools offers a way to easily download and manage fonts from Google fonts or
other pluggable providers. The current version only works with Google fonts,
however you are free to create your own sources and converters that will be
able to work out what you need.

#### Getting started

The first thing would be to put the font families that you want into the
`settings.py` of your project. By example:

```python
WOOLS_FONTS_FAMILIES = [
    ('google', 'Roboto'),
    ('google', 'Nunito'),
]
```

Here we're getting Roboto and Nunito from Google Fonts.

> *Note* &mdash; Please make sure that `django_wools` is in your
> `INSTALLED_APPS` for this to work.

Now let's run the download command:

```
./manage.py wools_import_fonts
```

And finally, let's put this tag in your page's HTML:

```html
{% load wools_fonts %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="{{ CURRENT_LANG }}">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

    <title>{{ title }}</title>

    {% fonts_head %}
</head>
</html>
```

And that's it! The fonts you asked for will be loaded automatically.

#### Configuration options

There is several settings that you can adjust.

##### `WOOLS_FONTS_DIR`

Directory name relative to the static root where the files will be stored.

> *Default*: `"fonts"`

##### `WOOLS_STATIC_ROOT`

Absolute path to the static root that you want to use to store the fonts. If
set to none, the first value from `STATICFILES_DIRS` will be used instead.

> *Default*: `None`

##### `WOOLS_FAMILIES`

Font families that you want to load. It's a list of (provider, family) tuples.

Instead of providing tuples, you can provide 
`django_wools.settings_types.FontFamily` instances directly. In case you don't
provide them, the tuple will be passed as *args to the constructor of
`FontFamily`.

> *Default*: `[]`

##### `WOOLS_FONTS_PROVIDERS`

Dictionary of available font providers. The key is the name of the provider
while the value is the FQN of the class.

If you want to provide your own provider, you can specifcy any class as long as
it implements the `django_wools.fonts.WoolFontProvider` interface.

> *Default*: `{"google": "django_wools.fonts.GoogleFontsProvider"}`

##### `WOOLS_FONTS_FORMATS`

List of font formats that you want. Choices are `ttf`, `woff`, `woff2`, `eot`,
`svg`, `otf`. You can also directly provide instances of
`django_wools.settings_types.FontFormat`.

Font formats will be proposed in the same order to the browser.

> *Default*: `[FontFormat.woff2, FontFormat.ttf]`

##### `WOOLS_FONTS_CONVERSIONS`

Font sources will provide the fonts in a given format (most likely TTF) but in
order to produce the formats expected by `WOOLS_FONTS_FORMATS` you need to
convert those fonts.

This is a dictionary that as key takes a tuple of (from_format, to_format) and
as value a sequential list of converters to use.

By example, suppose that you only have "TTF to WOFF2" and "EOT to TTF" avaible
and your source is in EOT while formats are TTF and WOFF2. In that case you can
specificy that the conversion from "EOT to WOFF2" goes through TTF.

> *Default*:

```python
{
    (FontFormat.ttf, FontFormat.woff): ["django_wools.fonts.TtfToWoff"],
    (FontFormat.ttf, FontFormat.woff2): ["django_wools.fonts.TtfToWoff2"],
}
```
